## Backend

I used Python Flask as the backend for the application and SQL database for the blog section initially for local development, and switched to DETA database and hosted the flask server on heroku ( https://tinkernews.herokuapp.com/ ) 
### Functions of Flask app
* Login to flask server at https://tinkernews.herokuapp.com/login
* Add new blog at https://tinkernews.herokuapp.com/api/add
* View and delete blog at https://tinkernews.herokuapp.com/api/list


### App Feature
* You can now hear the latest news and your favourite blogs from tinkerers using the text-to-speech feature, implemented using flutter_tts library.
